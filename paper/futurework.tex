\section{Future Work}
\label{section:futurework}
While all of the required goals were met, future work could improve upon the application by optimizing board modelling
and manipulation through maintining a single array of queen information rather than a 2D representation of the board
with queen state stored withing. This would improve on both storage and -- more so -- on computation times.

Additionally, future work could include visualization of the algorithm's success, making it easier to understand.
