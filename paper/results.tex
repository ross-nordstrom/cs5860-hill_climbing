\section{Results}
\label{section:results}
Here, approaches taken and results found are presented for each of the questions in the assignment. Evaluations were
made against a single randomly generated board in order to consistently compare their success. A side effect of this
is that some evaluations on better boards were highly successful, while worse boards were much less successful.

\subsection{Basic Hill Climbing}
The success of the basic hill climbing algorithm largely depends on the starting board layout. Given that, the results
found are most meaningful when compared to the success of evaluations allowing sideways moves and/or random restarts.
