\section{Results}
\label{section:results}
Here, approaches taken and results found are presented for each of the questions in the assignment. Evaluations were
made against a single randomly generated board in order to consistently compare their success. A side effect of this
is that some evaluations on better boards were highly successful, while worse boards were much less successful.

\subsection{Basic Hill Climbing}
By specifying a number of ``times'' in the evaluation configuration, the application will try to do hill climbing that
many times on a randomly generated board each time.
