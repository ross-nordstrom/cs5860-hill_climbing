## Abstract
>    This paper presents a solution to a home work assignment using the N-Queens problem to drive
     an understanding of local search. The solution presented here is built in AngularJS, complete
     with a UI and complete parametrization, single step evaluation, and a debug view to help
     teach how N-Queens and hill climbing work. The results are best viewed live by running
     the accompanying code suite in a browser, with installation instructions in the README.md file.
